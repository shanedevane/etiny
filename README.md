# etiny: Explorable tiny models for your second brain

28,000+ pieces of advice distilled from key books on the topics of personal goals, career advice and startup pitch decks.

Each model package comes with an ONNX model, JSON source attributes, excerpts, custom advice, regex detectors, a vector index, and neural scoring engine.

Use cli tools to explore your own .md and .txt files via command or use Claude Cowork, OpenAI Chat GPT directly with the JSON fies and Python scripts.

## Usage
You can use the packages via the cli toos OR you can use with Claude Cowork et. al.

```bash
etiny pull personal-goals         # fetch the personal-goals bundle (~36 MB, sha-verified)
etiny scan notes.md               # scan a document (regex plus the optional neural pass)
etiny scan                        # every .md in the current folder (stdin when piped)
etiny walk                        # every .md in every subfolder
etiny elevators                   # list the source works with their counts
etiny elevations "fear of failure"  # search the rule corpus, any word or phrase
etiny list                        # every model you can pull
etiny models                      # what's installed
etiny use pitch-decks             # switch the default model
etiny update                      # check for newer bundles
etiny upgrade                     # fetch newer bundles
etiny doctor                      # environment and store diagnostics
```

**Global Parameters**
Every command takes `--json`; there are no other flags to learn. Bare `etiny`
onboards: it pulls the default model and shows the shortest path to a first scan.
